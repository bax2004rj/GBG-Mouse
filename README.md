# GBG-Mouse
A specialized mouse for programming in Game Builder Garage. It will combine the AGTD system with a normal mouse+ config software. Currently it is mostly an idea, but it will be worked on eventually.
## Feature Ideas
- Open source design based on the Arduino Leonardo/ pro micro
- Based on the AGTD texture import system, with special button to trigger texture drawing
- Special configuration software that allows for adding and importing textures, available for Windows/Mac/Linux
- Micro SD card slot for adding custom textures
## What will be here when I work on it
- Compiled versions of the configuration tool (writen in python)
- STL files for 3d printing the parts
- KiCad files for schematics/custom PCB designs (small breadboards are ok too)
- Source code for config tool and modified AGTD arduino code
